Here are the projects which i have done in my virtual internship with #codealpha. Thank you CodeAlpha for giving me this opportunity. Following were the tasks assigned:

Task:- do-to list application 

This C++ program is a console-based to-do list application using basic data structures and control flow algorithms. The program:

Task Class: Represents a single task with a description and a completion status.

Todo list Class: Manages a list of tasks. It has methods to add tasks, mark them as completed, and view the current tasks.

Main Function: Provides a simple text-based menu for the user to interact with the application. It uses a loop to keep the application running until the user chooses to exit.
